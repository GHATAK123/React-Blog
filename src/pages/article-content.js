          `Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework that follows the model-template-view (MVC) architectural pattern.[5][6] It is maintained by the Django Software Foundation (DSF), an American independent organization established as a 501(c)(3) non-profit.

          Django's primary goal is to ease the creation of complex, database-driven websites. The framework emphasizes reusability and "pluggability" of components, less code, low coupling, rapid development, and the principle of don't repeat yourself.[7] Python is used throughout, even for settings files and data models. Django also provides an optional administrative create, read, update and delete interface that is generated dynamically through introspection and configured via admin models.
          
          Some well known sites that use Django include PBS,[8] Instagram,[9] Mozilla,[10] The Washington Times,[11] Disqus,[12] Bitbucket,[13] and Nextdoor.[14]`,

          `Angular 7 is a TypeScript based full-stack web application by Google. It enables you to create Single Page Applications(SPA) with the help of the concept of components. The components in Angular 7 are structured like a tree i.e. there are parent and child components in which each child component is connected to its respective parent component.

Angular 8 is a ground-breaking JavaScript framework which makes us able to create an attractive Single Page Application(SPAs). Its first version was released in 2012 and named as AngularJS.

          `Ruby on Rails, or Rails, is a server-side web application framework written in Ruby under the MIT License. Rails is a model–view–controller (MVC) framework, providing default structures for a database, a web service, and web pages. It encourages and facilitates the use of web standards such as JSON or XML for data transfer and HTML, CSS and JavaScript for user interfacing. In addition to MVC, Rails emphasizes the use of other well-known software engineering patterns and paradigms, including convention over configuration (CoC), don't repeat yourself (DRY), and the active record pattern.[4]

          Ruby on Rails' emergence in 2005 greatly influenced web app development, through innovative features such as seamless database table creations, migrations, and scaffolding of views to enable rapid application development. Ruby on Rails' influence on other web frameworks remains apparent today, with many frameworks in other languages borrowing its ideas, including Django in Python, Catalyst in Perl, Laravel and CakePHP in PHP, Phoenix in Elixir, Play in Scala, and Sails.js in Node.js.`,
